            It's the official end of the first week of discipleship training school (DTS). The <i>general consensus</i>
            is that
            it
            has felt
            like we've been here for many weeks already. Not only because the days have been long and jam packed with
            events, but
            because of the pace that friendships have already grown. One day you are learning what everyone's name is
            and
            the next
            you are sharing <b>your darkest struggles</b>. That's the thing about community living, <b>you</b> <i>can
                only hide
                who you
                really are
                for </i> <b>sooo long.</b> My classmates see each other at our most vulnerable, weakest and challenging
            moments.
            Transparency
            is
            inevitable here. It's something that I personally struggle with. I am naturally introverted and have grown
            comfortable
            with the walls I've built up around me. One thing God has really shown me is that: there is no room for
            pride in
            <i>the
                kingdom of God.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            We got to hear from the founders of this base about how YWAM Ships came to be. The week was filled with
            incredible
            stories of how God performed miracle after miracle to fulfill what He had promised. His <b>Word</b> never
            fails.
            The
            common
            thing that really struck me was that God kept moving in the individual to present the big picture. In
            lecture,
            they
            talked about how <b>God works in us as a group</b> like a <i>jigsaw puzzle</i>. Everyone gets a piece of
            information that
            might not
            make sense initially until you place it all together with the rest of <i>the body of Christ</i>. <i>That's
                why
                community
                is so
                important</i>, why <b>YOU</b> <i>are so important</i>. They handed us each a puzzle piece... mine was
            this
            unimpressive
            shade
            of
            brown. I
            didn't think much of it until I saw the picture that each piece was a part of. It was this cozy village on
            the
            sea side
            with the sun setting over the ocean. My piece was no longer merely this plain shade of brown but a perfect
            tone
            of sea
            shore tan. <i>Imagine if I had thrown away my piece</i> because I considered it worthless and ugly? Imagine
            working
            so
            hard to
            do a thousand piece puzzle only to find that one piece is missing? <b>It'd ruin the entire picture!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been reading through 1 Corinthians since before I came here and only God could perfectly time that I
            would reach
            chapter twelve right at this moment. "Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts
            form
            one body,
            so it is with Christ... But in fact God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he
            wanted
            them to
            be. If they were all one part, where would the body be?" 1Cor 12:12 ;18 The <b>LORD</b> has <i>created us
                all
                with our
                uniqueness</i>
            for a reason and for a purpose. The world has distorted this uniqueness in individuals throughout the years
            by
            calling
            those who stand out "weird", "strange" or that they "don't fit in." But what if it wasn't our original
            design to
            copy
            each other as clones do but rather to use our gifts to reflect the depth and vastness of <i>one eternal
                God?</i>
