        <p>
            Lately I’ve been reading through the book of Mark during my morning quiet times. It always happens that you
            can read
            over a part of scripture a few times in your life without thinking too much of it until the Holy Spirit
            reveals
            something so profound that you wonder how you ever missed it in the first place. I’ve been stuck on this
            passage over
            the past few days alone and I’m still not done learning from it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Mark 5: 21-43 is entitled “Jesus raises a dead girl and heals a sick woman”
            First off, Jesus is barely stepping off the boat when this large multitude runs up to him. Like how did
            Jesus not become
            overwhelmed with so many people? In this multitude is a man named Jairus who happens to be a synagogue
            leader. Now a
            synagogue leader running to Jesus in itself stopped me in my tracks. This man lived his life in religion,
            following
            rules and regulations. Most religious leaders didn’t (and don’t) care much for Jesus and actually saw him as
            a threat to
            everything they knew. Messiah was supposed to be a strong military leader who set his people free, not one
            who ran with
            a multitude of society's outcasts. Yet here is this religious man running to Jesus and “fell at his feet” as
            soon as he
            saw Him. The man’s request? That Jesus would come into his house to heal his dying daughter. This man
            abandoned all
            religion to finally surrender to Jesus, the ultimate authority.
            <br>
            <br>
            Along the way to Jairus’ house we are introduced to a woman with a problem of bleeding. In scripture we
            learn that this
            woman “suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of
            getting better she
            grew worse.” This woman went through a great deal of seeking healing from the world. No doctor or medicine
            could cure
            her and in fact made her condition worse. In Jewish law, a woman in this condition would be considered
            unclean and would
            have to seclude herself from others. Yet here she was, risking everything to be in the multitude close to
            Jesus. She
            surrendered the world’s diagnosis of being incurable and of the rules of the law that told her she did not
            belong. So in
            one brave move, she stretched out her hands to touch the tassels of Jesus “and she felt in her body that she
            was freed
            from her suffering.”
            <br>
            <br>
            Two very different people from very different backgrounds were only able to come to the feet of Jesus once
            they
            surrendered all that they knew.
            <br>
            <br>
            The story doesn’t end there. At different moments, Jesus comforts each at their lowest moments. Jesus stops
            the crowd
            and makes sure that this woman knows she is seen by Jesus not just as another in the crowd but she is seen
            as his child.
            “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.” Then the unthinkable
            happens to
            Jairus, one of his servants meets him with the news that his daughter has passed away. Before another word
            is even
            spoken, Jesus immediately says to Jairus “Don’t be afraid, just believe.”
            Jesus isn’t an impersonal God who is just there to perform signs and wonders and leaves. No dear friend, He
            is one who
            comforts us and sees us when the world tells us that our situation is beyond hope. He is “El Roi” the God
            who sees us.
            <br>
            <br>
            During my time serving Him, I have experienced this first hand. While in the middle of outreach I felt
            myself running on
            fumes and wondering if God was even near. I was frustrated and holding onto a spirit of self-pity when He
            sent His
            assurance in a way that only He can. We were serving a youth group in Georgia when one of the young adults
            asked my
            leader, “this is random but do you happen to have anyone named Christina on your team?” After being pointed
            out, this
            woman who I’ve never met before walked up to me and began to share how God had given her a word for me. She
            began to
            speak in detail about things that I had only told God about and then in the most comforting voice she said,
            “God sees
            you.” That evening I surrendered all that I was holding onto and for the first time in a while I was able to
            rest in the
            unexplainable peace of Jesus.
            <br>
            <br>
            He hears your cries and sees the struggles that you are going through. He wants to heal you from the inside
            out and is
            eager to replace all the world’s lies with His truth. The only question is: are you ready to surrender?
